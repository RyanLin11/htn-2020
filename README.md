## Inspiration

During this pandemic, we were inspired by the researchers who are working diligently to get us a lifesaving vaccine. To make their challenges relatable to the everyday person, we created The Vaccine Labyrinth, a maze that forces the player to overcome obstacles, complete challenges, and navigate corridors to reach the vaccine. The game becomes more difficult over time, simulating the race against time for researchers to prevent the disease from spreading. 

## What it does

The Vaccine Labyrinth is a maze game in which players complete tasks to unlock passageways with the ultimate goal of finding the vaccine. Players must find the vaccine before 60 seconds is up, and their radius of visibility shrinks with time. If players are unsuccessful, they spawn at the starting point and must attempt the same maze again, with the help of their previous memory.

## How we built it

We built it using the base framework provided by Ubisoft for the Hack the North challenge. 

## Challenges we ran into

At first we had trouble making and running the existing game files, but eventually figured out the software we needed to do so. Making the walking animations had some difficulty as changing directions was hard, and we had to completely rewrite the code to make it functional. The shrinking vision took a lot of trial and error to get completely right as well. Additionally, the font import didn't seem to be working, but eventually worked with a different file.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we can finish and demonstrate our game!

## What we learned

For many of us, it was our first time using SFML. Following the step-by-step tutorial, we learned how SFML can help us use our C++ knowledge to create games. We also learned a lot about designing interesting game mechanics, collaborating on Github, and the structure of game applications. Overall, it was a great opportunity to explore game development!

## What's next for The Vaccine Labyrinth

As a result of the short deadline, there were many features that we simply did not have enough time to add. We would add multiple levels with randomly generated mazes as well as a greater variety of puzzles. We could also add enemies like germs that would block the player's path and give the player weapons such as disinfectant to defend themselves against those enemies.
